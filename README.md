The Department, Actives, Separations, and Recruitment report pages will be included in our Business Intelligence (BI) solution. With regard to particular facets of personnel management, like the overall number of employees, turnover rates, demographics, and sources of recruiting, each page will provide insights and visualizations. Filtering data by department, year, quarter, and other criteria will allow users to do in-depth study and make well-informed decisions.
